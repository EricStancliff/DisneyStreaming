# DisneyStreaming

To build you will need Visual Studio 2019, Relatively recent CMake, the Vulkan SDK (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/), and GIT.  This build only has been tested on Windows.

CMake will pull VKL and vcpkg which will initiate a number of other third party downloads.  You should only have to run cmake, build in VS2019, then run disney_streaming.exe from Visual Studio.
